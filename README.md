This repository is the place where everything regarding the project Comando do Eixo X do Pórtico Cartesiano, for the subject Projeto em Sistemas de Automação, was stored and organized. In this project there were 4 contributors : Pedro Silva 98379; João Tavares 97973; Miguel Costa 97511 and Beicy Viloria 114807.

Our main goal was to control the system via PLC and a web page using an ESP32, but we had some trouble with getting the material in time for the  final presentation.

We still gave our best and we are very happy with the results!!

Hope you enjoy our work, and if you have any improvements let us know.
